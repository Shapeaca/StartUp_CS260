# Elevator Pitch
### Idea
I want to make a simple web game. 
It will be a 2d platformer. There will be dungeon crawler elements and/or puzzle elements as well. 
The game will start as the player wakes up in a forest clearing near an entrance to a cave (Which is actually the dungeon.)
As the player progresses, they will learn more about this dungeon, and eventually, they will win when they reach the artifact. 
The player will also occasionally run into a check point that will respawn them there when they die.

### Key Features


### Technologies
##### HTML:
The website will have a few tabs that the user can navigate to, including a login tab, a leaderboard tab, and a play tab. 
##### CSS: 
The graphics of the game will be done pretty much entirely in CSS.
##### Javascript: 
The game's functionality, including movement, interaction, and attacking will be implemented entirely through javascript, as well as many other parts of the site.
##### Web service

##### Authentication:
The user will have to sign up / login before they will be able to play a game. They game will they attribute their save file to that user.
##### Database data:
This database will include all the users credentials, information about past play throughs (For the leaderboard), and their current game progress (Which will be a save file of some kind)
##### WebSocket data:
The Websocket connection will send data about the user's current game to the server, and store the data in the database.
Data that will be sent include: The user's current run time, the user's deaths in the run, the players current position. This will allow a score board to be built, and sorted based on different categories. Also, the position that is saved will allow the user to save their progress
##### Web framework
