Todo list:
    todo 8) recolor all text so it is easier to read

todo list js:
    1) Make a very basic game framework that is capable of:
        * Removing objects
        * Game End
        * randomization of preset obstacles:
           * I create different placements/functions that create a wall of blocks, and then I randomize which one will be selected
        * Use of Promise - to prevent browser lock when I'm playing the game
        * detecting collisions of objects!!! (I can soo do this! I did this in 6th grade!!!)
    3) Create a account tab on the upper-right of each screen that shows when a user is logged in
        - prevent the game from being played (and maybe the table from being loaded) until a user is logged in

               6) Add an end screen and a play again button
