Todo list:
    1) Deploy Simon.js
    8) recolor all text so it is easier to read
    9) Make the database list like the top 10 results, as well as the current User's rating and their rank

todo list js:
    1) Make a very basic game framework that is capable of:
        * Removing objects
        * Use of Promise - to prevent browser lock when I'm playing the game
        * editing the attributes of objects
        * detecting collisions of objects!!! (I can soo do this! I did this in 6th grade!!!)
    2) Make a signup page with buttons and stuff
    3) Make javascript files for saving data and calling endpoints.
    4) Create a account tab on the upper-right of each screen that shows when a user is logged in
        - prevent the game from being played (and maybe the table from being loaded) until a user is logged in
    4) finish javascript homeworks
